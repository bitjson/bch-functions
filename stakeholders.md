The goal of the [Cash Improvement Proposal (CHIP) process](https://blog.bitjson.com/bitcoin-cash-upgrade-2023/#why-chips) is to coordinate upgrades to Bitcoin Cash without a central authority by developing proposals in a collaborative, public process.

**CHIP maintainers are expected to actively seek out stakeholders and demonstrate widespread ecosystem approval.**

This includes approval from node and virtual machine implementations, wallets, and other open source software projects, educational institutions and community initiatives, and industry actors like exchanges, miners, services, and other businesses.

The following statements have been submitted in support of this CHIP.

> The ‘Functions’ CHIP is a modern adaptation of an old but very powerful idea for improving the scripting language. With CashScript we had already run into the need for macros/libraries to make the high level language developer friendly & powerful. The idea to enable data-as-code by evaluating as bytecode is general concept but the devil is in the details of the implementation. With the benefit of a much better understanding of the evolution of the VM we’re able to look at these old ideas through a new lens.
>
> The first iteration of the proposal, OP_EVAL, made strides in arguing against any kind of ‘stack isolation’ which is an anti-feature in practice. After great discussion with many back-and-forths, the proposal changed its approach to using 2 opcodes: OP_DEFINE & OP_INVOKE. The main reason being that stack juggling whole functions is actually a big drawback for creating compilers and optimizing contract code. With the 2nd iteration of the proposal, the discussion focused on possible dangers of allowing “function factories” and adding “mutation tracking” safety rails. The whole process thoroughly explored the solution space with multiple variations. With the current (unrestricted) functions CHIP coming out as the best solution.
>
> The Functions CHIP represents a major unlock in the power of the VM, enabled by the prior work on VM limits. We can expect to see permissionless innovation for a much more advanced class of contracts including quantumproof cryptography, zero-knowledge usecases, cross language compilers. This will move out the frontier of innovation, allowing for exploration of very exciting new ideas. I fully support the Functions CHIP for activation in May 2026!

> —<cite>Mathieu Geukens, [Cashonize](https://www.cashonize.com/), [ParityUSD](https://parityusd.com/), [CashScript](https://www.cashscript.org/) developer, [Tokenaut](https://www.tokenaut.cash/) <a href="https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/2026-layla-upgrade-lock-in-chip-endorsements-thread/1672/6">⧉</a></cite>

> With the VM limits CHIP in place finally we can safely enable functions inside our already powerful VM, and functions will serve as a great enabler and amplifier. Functions will let people structure their UTXO programs in ways that avoid errors, and will let people pack advanced contract logic into less bytes. It will simplify quantum-resistant solutions, and it will enable more privacy through MAST-like design patterns. The design of DEFINE/INVOKE is solid and all decisions have a solid rationale. I fully endorse this CHIP for 2026 activation!

> This is a very exciting CHIP that will, together with Loops, unlock a lot of power to contract authors. Fully endorse.
>
> Even though I find the predecessor CHIP (OP_EVAL) cleaner from a more academic point of view, where the stack is the state of the VM, I agree with the rationale of using a function table.

> I’ve reviewed the CHIP-2025-05 Functions v2.0.2 as well as Takes 2 & 3, CHIP 2024-12 OP_EVAL, CHIP 2025-1-Subroutines and the comments on this thread and the original thread.
>
> **I support the unrestricted variant of CHIP-2025-05 Functions** to unleash Bitcoin Cash smart contracts for advanced applications while maintaining performance and auditability.
>
> I don’t see a need to prevent delegation or mutation because I don’t believe footgun avoidance (protecting contract devs from making mistakes) should be a design principle in the VM. It will lead to restricted functionality or increased complexity or both. We have footguns in the virtual machine already (examples of which have been provided) and we accept them as one of the costs of programmable money.
>
> We can’t give developers the power to succeed spectacularly without also giving them the power to fail spectacularly. I don’t doubt that mistakes will be made, funds will be lost and lessons will be learned the hard way. But the alternative is to stay on the sidelines.
>
> Ethereum has `DELEGATECALL`, the mother of all footguns. 400,000 ETH lost in February this year, 150,000 ETH in 2017.
>
> But their community doesn’t consider the opcode a mistake. Highly successful dapps like Uniswap [use it](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/0682387198a24c7cd63566a2c58398533860a5d1/contracts/base/Multicall.sol#L14) and take great care in higher level languages [not to misuse it](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/d8b1c635c275d2a9450bd6a78f3fa2484fef73eb/contracts/NoDelegateCall.sol#L6).
>
> We can do likewise. For example `OP_DEFINEVERIFY` is a great idea and could be a sensible default in CashScript output but doesn’t need an opcode if it’s just shorthand. This is analagous to Solidity’s `library` keyword which makes `DELEGATECALL` safer without any new opcodes.
>
> I’m excited to see what gets built on this. Kudos to Jason and everyone on the threads here for a robust and valuable debate.
>
> —<cite>Richard Brady, [Coinbooth](https://coinbooth.io) <a href="https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/chip-2025-08-functions-takes-2-3/1656/61">⧉</a></cite>

> Over the past several years, the Bitcoin Cash Virtual Machine has undergone significant upgrades (such as Introspection and CashTokens), greatly expanding its capabilities. These improvements have enabled the development of advanced smart contract systems - comparable to those on EVM-based platforms - while still preserving the efficiency of Bitcoin’s original UTXO model. True to Bitcoin’s founding vision, this ensures BCH remains both affordable and scalable as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system.
>
> Jason’s Functions CHIP (2025-05) manages to improve this efficiency even further by allowing compression of BCH Contract Systems, thus reducing the transaction costs for many Smart Contract use-cases. At scale, these compression benefits become very beneficial towards BCH’s goal of reaching mass adoption. Just as importantly, the CHIP’s simple, non-constrained, approach also allows for many future discovered/undiscovered use-cases (e.g. Quantum Proof Vaults, MAST-like constructs that also allow code-execution) to be implemented optimally without requiring additional, specialized, changes to the BCH VM itself - or incurring technical-debt that might need to be undone later.
>
> For these reasons, the Functions CHIP (2025-05) has my full support and endorsement.
>

> I endorse CHIP-2025-05 Functions (without Takes 2 & 3) for 2026 lock-in.
>
> In my mind there is no doubt about the massive value that functions provide to a programming language. The Functions CHIP delivers a lot of that value to Bitcoin Cash. One of the key benefits of functions is that they provide a means of abstraction which is how complexity is tamed as contracts grow larger ([albaVm HTML logs example](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/albadsl-albavm-haskell-based-dsl-and-vm-for-bitcoin-cash-2025-contract-programming/1558/22)). Abstraction allows developers to create higher-level constructs out of primitives, and then work at this higher-level without being distracted by the details. Abstraction removes a lot of code repetition and makes contract code easier to audit, increasing safety. In addition, functions allow for recursion which can be used to succinctly express certain algorithms, also simplifying review.
>
> What risks are associated with the Functions CHIP? As with any change there is the risk of introducing bugs along with the implementation. Having implemented the Functions CHIP myself in albaVm, my view is that it is simple and not riskier to implement than other CHIPs we have delivered recently.
>
> Metaprogramming has been brought up as a risk. But it is also a useful feature that allows the Functions CHIP to offer run-time-created immutable tables with cheap lookups ([Windowed EC scalar multiplication example](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/albadsl-albavm-haskell-based-dsl-and-vm-for-bitcoin-cash-2025-contract-programming/1558/23)). I don’t view metaprogramming as a downside. Even today it is possible to do very limited scale metaprogramming using evaluators like [TurtleVm](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/turtlevm-a-meta-circular-evaluator-for-bitcoin-cash-script-proof-of-concept/1638). And the Loops CHIP (2026) will make such evaluators a lot more practical.
>
> There is a risk that we will discover a better design for functions down the road. This risk has been mitigated by all the hard work that has gone into this CHIP, and I think we have a really good design. I don’t think that delaying this CHIP for another year would be productive. The main contender to the Functions CHIP, OP_EVAL, was investigated thoroughly by the community. I implemented it in albaVm & albaDsl and wrote contract code using it. In my view the Functions CHIP better solves for the common use case of having functions that are globally available from any part of the contract at little cost. It also provides a better compilation target for CashScript. OP_EVAL on its own does not solve as well for this, but could still be a useful construct for other use cases. So it is worth keeping on the radar. Also note that the Functions CHIP does solve for immutable lambdas.
>
> I think we have great momentum as a community right now and that we should capitalize on this moment and release functions in 2026. It will be a huge boost for Bitcoin Cash!

> I wholly endorse CHIP 2024-12 P2S, CHIP 2021-05 Loops, CHIP 2025-05 Functions, and CHIP 2025-05 Bitwise.
>
> P2S - Liberalizes some limits that were only put in place as an emergency measure to plug potential DoS in the early days of Bitcoin BTC (holes that don't exist on BCH anymore). Being able to pay to scripts of up to 201 bytes directly simplifies so much in terms of contracts, and liberalizing lots of the other script limits (such as scriptSig being 10KB now) is extremely critical for smart contract development and only makes sense. Ditto for token commitments having more payload. The VMLimits upgrade of 2025 ensures this liberalization is safe and cannot be abused.
>
> Loops - Very conservative but crucial upgrade to the FORTH-like language that is the BCH VM, allowing for loops in script contract code in a very "forth" way (basically even the op-code names and semantics are ones used in some FORTH dialects). Will make some contract applications much more expressive and act as a form of "compression" to reduce contract bloat. VMLimits ensures loops are bounded and cannot hang anything or abuse computing resources beyond what is normal such as the cost of a signature check. No risk, high reward.
>
> Functions - Similarly, functions allow for code-reuse and reduce contract "bloat". They make some computations that would be awkward or incredibly difficult to achieve without functions, achievable in a single contract or contract series. VMLimits again ensure no abuse is possible. Should make porting contracts from e.g. EVM over to "CashVM" more achievable and tractable. Also makes BCH seem like a "real" programmable money chain and should create some developer delight. No risk, high reward, basically.
>
> Bitwise - Re-enables some op-codes that were emergency-disabled by Satoshi back in the day due to DoS concerns, and also adds a new set of bitwise OPs that didn't exist in original Satoshi Bitcoin that allow for alternate ways of doing bit manipulations (either binary or numeric). Due to the fact that we have VMLimits now to constrain expensive operations, will be zero-risk -- and high reward since bit manipulation is _very_ useful for programming in general and for some specialized BCH contracts in particular.
>
> Therefore I am very proud to have consulted on these CHIPs, to have implemented their proof of concept, and to be a "bcasher" and to see these activated in 2026. It's a wonderful time to be in BCH! Very cool!
>
> So yes. I support these upgrades and look forward to seeing them live on-chain in consensus as of mid-day May 15th, 2026.

> I tentatively endorse locking in the following CHIPs for the Bitcoin Cash 2026 upgrade cycle:
>
> - 2021-05 Loops: Bounded Looping Operations
> - 2025-05 Functions: Function Definition and Invocation Operations
> - 2025-05 Bitwise: Re-Enable Bitwise Operations
>
> Loops, Functions, and Bitwise Operations are critical operations that are found in nearly all programming languages. Thanks to the 2025 BCH "VMLA" (Virtual Machine Limits & Arithmetic) upgrade, these powerful constructs can now be safely introduced with negligible concern for their impact on transaction size or validation time.
>
> These common programming constructs are among the final pieces necessary to realize the completion of Bitcoin Cash as a fully-fledged "peer to peer electronic cash **system**". The BCH VM is a high-performance, Turing complete, perfectly parallelizable system that allows any user to permissionlessly transact with any other user in a provably non-forgeable, trustlessly verifiable manner. While the base layer is primarily focused on being "cash" (money), we must remember that money has many functions complementary to, and in addition to the fundamental "Alice pays Bob" function.
>
> Loops and Bitwise are expected to lock in as-is with widespread approval. However, it is worth highlighting that I am specifically endorsing @bitjson's "2025-05 Functions", NOT the "take 2" or "take 3" alternatives proposed by @cculianu.
>
> While the CHIPs proposed by Calin thoughtfully explore variations to Jason's CHIP, I agree with the conclusive opinion from both authors that Jason's original CHIP is the better option. In my opinion, Jason has sufficiently investigated and addressed any remaining contention with the behavior of OP_DEFINE and OP_INVOKE, including concerns about malicious code mutability, "metaprogramming", delegated invocation, and "data as code".

> As discussed on [The Bitcoin Cash Podcast Episode 157](https://youtu.be/h2xjYjqI7_Y?t=4033), community polling indicates a high appetite for protocol innovation & upgrades - presumably built on the confidence of previous upgrade quality & results. It is very noticeable how the CashTokens upgrade in 2023 is living up to expectations in late 2025. There has been no problems really to speak of & impressive traction/uptake of CashTokens technology. I have a biased favourite project in the BLISS NFT ticket collections, but the success of CashTokens is widespread and compelling. One excellent recent example, congratulations to the Riften Labs team on [recently passing $1M USD TVL on Cauldron](https://x.com/dagur/status/1963906886048022999)! The mounting success of the CashTokens ecosystem speaks to the quality of both research & implementation of BCH upgrades and the community’s ability to make powerful investments in those upgrades without expecting instant gratification. The trend is set to continue in 2026.
>
> Loops, Functions & Bitwise operations are all standard issue features of essentially every programming language ever so I’m glad to see the BCH VM catching up to that standard. Loops demonstrates that yet again the BCH community is able to bypass propaganda & misunderstandings (“Bitcoin VM has no loops”) in a way that other cryptocurrency communities severely struggle to. I was also impressed by the community debate that produced the final products (including iterating Functions from OP_EVAL, different function variations & the removal of lowering base-instruction cost). It is critical for the CHIP process & the work produced to be evaluated & critiqued without contention becoming unresolvable.
>
> I would also like to note I see an underrated value in the P2S CHIP specifically - moving P2S from non-standard relay policy to standard. Especially given the current drama in BTC over [policy/consensus gap exploitation (aka “Node wars” between “Knots/filters” vs “Core/spammers”)](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/non-standard-transactions-out-of-band-miner-submission/1257/24), I see a strong opportunity for BCH to once against front-run potential problems by a research effort (& possibly CHIP) to unify policy/consensus where appropriate or document the status/reasoning and reflect on alternative solutions where not. For instance, perhaps an ABLA/DAA style approach - either by consensus or policy - could be used for minimum fee rates? Needs investigation. BitcoinCashAutist (notable CHIP contributor) also mentioned this in [his 2026 CHIP endorsement](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/2026-layla-upgrade-lock-in-chip-endorsements-thread/1672/3). I encourage readers interested in this initiative to read or contribute to [my Bitcoin Cash Research thread](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/non-standard-transactions-out-of-band-miner-submission/1257) about this topic of non-standard transactions.
>
> In any case, the four endorsed CHIPs combined make a very powerful upgrade. I’m thrilled to see BCH making bold strides forward to accelerate our growing momentum & industry-leading presence in UTXO DeFi. I am also glad to be a part of the momentum around endorsements ([my own endorsement in 2024](https://bitcoincashpodcast.com/blog/chip-endorsement-may-2025) was not published until late October) & developer tooling/education (sign up to [BCH BLAZE](https://dorahacks.io/hackathon/bchblaze2025/detail)!).
>
> There is also great stuff on the horizon with the [1 minute blocks proposal](https://gitlab.com/0353F40E/fablous) continuing [to be discussed](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/chip-2025-03-faster-blocks-for-bitcoin-cash/1513/124). I would love to see UTXO Commitments start to be focussed on in more detail & the relay policy ideas mentioned above but that’s simply my wishful thinking - as always, a /someone problem!
>
> Finally, a big thank you to Jason Dreyzehner for his tireless work on these proposals & anyone who has been involved in feedback, review, implementation, testing or assistance of any kind. It’s a team effort and testament to a decentralised community but Jason also deserves specific recognition for his ceaseless effort here. Delivering two enormous upgrades back-to-back is an effort that will resonate through BCH history in perpetuity.

> Layla follows CashTokens & Velma in bringing BCH to the forefront of cryptocurrency scriptability and will draw in ever more interested parties as a result. I’m enthused & anticipating activation already!

> I endorse all 4 CHIPs for $bch's 2026 lock-in: P2S, Functions, Loops, and Shifts.
>
> I was on the fence about functions but once I realized the foot gun argument applies even more to the eth vm which is the most widely used vm in crypto the argument stopped making sense to me.
>
> I think now the Bch Vm will be in a really good place and will become less of a priority.

> Function Definition and Invocation (CHIP-2025-05) enables more powerful, developer-friendly contracts. Refined through extensive debate, I now support its activation in the May 2026 upgrade.

> Functions is the chip most difficult for me to be confident about and it has the potential to impact practically every aspect of using the BitcoinCash scripting language. I do not come from a technical enough background to fully evaluate all aspects of this CHIP.
>
> However, through the discussion that have happened since the May 2025 upgrade, I have come to the conclusion that there is a significant risk of infrastructure and other projects in the space investing in non-trivial workarounds. Having seen first-hand the amount of work that can go into commiting to using clearly non-ideal solutions, and the additional difficulty in verifying safety for such work-arounds, I have decided that simplicity is the better trade-off.
>
> Furthermore, previously, I had preferred a wait-and-see approach and that it would be fine to hold off on functions for May 2027, but this would give a full year of active development of potential workarounds, so I am somewhat reluctantly endorsing CHIP-2025-05 Functions: Function Definition and Invocation Operations for activation in May 2026 in the hope that we will avoid cementing such workarounds in popular infrastructure tooling.

> I endorse the Unrestricted Function CHIP because I cannot sense any immediate danger to Bitcoin Cash from it. I also understand that it brings full (and very convenient to code) turing completeness to BCH, which is a great boon to all programmers that would like to make apps that run purely on Bitcoin Cash Blockchain.
>
> Also, if I understood correctly, it enables direct almost 1-to-1 porting of code from other programming languages into BCH which sounds insanely powerful in the long run.
>
> My competence level on this topic is far from 100%, so I can only hope I did not make any mistake here and this technology is solid. But I also believe that even if something breaks, BCH community has the power to fix it. We will cross that bridge when we come to it.

> As an ecosystem supporter and a Fulcrum server operator, I wholly endorse CHIP 2024-12 P2S, CHIP 2021-05 Loops, CHIP 2025-05 Functions, and CHIP 2025-05 Bitwise.
>
> After reading through the incredibly thorough forum discussions, along with my one-on-one discussions with BCH devs, I have no concerns with the activation of these CHIPs nor with my infrastructure's ability to continue operating effectively. I fully expect that projects I've contributed to, as their respective devs have mentioned, will be able to make more than efficient and effective use of these upgrades.
>
> The substantial work in evaluating and building the tools and tests by Jason Dreyzehner [@bitjson](https://x.com/bitjson) and Calin Culianu [@cculianu](https://x.com/cculianu), along with everyone else's feedback, criticisms, and suggestions, is awe-inspiring - and I couldn't be more thankful to them and everyone's efforts.
>
> I hope to see all these CHIPs locked-in in November and activated next year!
>
> Once locked-in, I will have these upgrades and respective descriptions added to [minisatoshi.cash/upgrade-history](https://minisatoshi.cash/upgrade-history).

> As we approach the lock-in for the May 2026 upgrade, discussion around the Functions CHIP has intensified with continued scrutiny and investigation. This has resulted in more understanding of the trade-offs involved and exploration of alternative approaches, allowing stakeholders to make an increasingly informed opinion.
>
> The deep work performed by Jason on creation of CHIPs has required significant effort to evaluate. It has also required discussion to elucidate a wide range of additional angles that increase confidence that all bases have been covered. That coverage has importantly included not only the immediate and longer term benefits, but also risks - more amorphous, harder to specify, and due to the one-way nature of consensus upgrades, critically important.
>
> General Protocols has been convinced that in the space of possible alternatives, including EVAL, modified versions of Functions and doing nothing, define/invoke is the best choice for BCH and endorses [CHIP-2025-05 Functions (Commit 26e2256)](https://github.com/bitjson/bch-functions/tree/26e22566a18f2f3b542ff46a70d258d5da585cd8) for 2026 activation.
>
> General Protocols also endorses the following CHIPs for 2026 activation:
>
> - [CHIP-2021-05 Loops (Commit bd3ebc7)](https://github.com/bitjson/bch-loops/tree/bd3ebc76bfa2190255fd3b5fcd84ec8910652f4e)
> - [CHIP-2024-12 P2S (Commit c144f03)](https://github.com/bitjson/bch-p2s/tree/c144f03fe11b6de0e924b2285b355370d0e658b8)
> - [CHIP-2025-05 Bitwise (Commit a432a19)](https://github.com/bitjson/bch-bitwise/tree/a432a19bcbc597391d0f0a29ae62a902b575d1dd)
